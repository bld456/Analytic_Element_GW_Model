Model completion:
1. Include infiltration
2. include wells 
3.set up system of equations that allow lake head to vary, include wells



Model implementation:
1. get values for (natural) head at each lake (metric)
2. get coordinates for lake minneotnka
3. extend coordinates for missippi + minnesota
4. vary inviltration rate
5. fudge the refrence point to get small amount of flow from infinity
